//! Low-power serial peripheral interface.
//!
//! [`Lpspi`] implements select embedded HAL SPI traits for coordinating SPI I/O.
//! When using the trait implementations, make sure that [`set_bit_order`](Lpspi::set_bit_order)
//! is correct for your device. These settings apply when the driver internally defines the transaction.
//!
//! This driver also exposes the peripheral's lower-level, hardware-dependent transaction interface.
//! Create a [`Transaction`], then [`enqueue_transaction`](Lpspi::enqueue_transaction) before
//! sending data with [`enqueue_data`](Lpspi::enqueue_data). When using the transaction interface,
//! you're responsible for serializing your data into `u32` SPI words.
//!
//! # Chip selects (CS) for SPI peripherals
//!
//! The iMXRT SPI peripherals have one or more peripheral-controlled chip selects (CS). Using
//! the peripheral-controlled CS means that you do not need a GPIO to coordinate SPI operations.
//! Blocking full-duplex transfers and writes will observe an asserted chip select while data
//! frames are exchanged / written.
//!
//! This driver generally assumes that you're using the peripheral-controlled chip select. If
//! you instead want to manage chip select in software, you should be able to multiplex your own
//! pins, then construct the driver [`without_pins`](Lpspi::without_pins).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Initialize an LPSPI with a 1MHz SCK. To understand how to configure the LPSPI
//! peripheral clock, see the [`ccm::lpspi_clk`](crate::ccm::lpspi_clk) documentation.

//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! Due to [a hardware defect][1], this driver does not yet support the EH02 SPI transaction API.
//! An early iteration of this driver reproduced the issue discussed in that forum. This driver may
//! be able to work around the defect in software, but it hasn't been explored.

//!
//! [`Transaction`] exposes the continuous / continuing flags, so you're free to model advanced
//! transactions. However, keep in mind that disabling the receiver during a continuous transaction
//! may not work as expected.
