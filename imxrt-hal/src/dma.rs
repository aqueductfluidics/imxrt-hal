//! Direct Memory Access (DMA)
//!
//! We support
//!
//! - DMA from memory to a peripheral. Transfers may be uni- or bi-directional.
//!   See the [`Peripheral`](struct.Peripheral.html) for details.
//! - DMA memory copy, or memory-to-memory transfers. See [`Memcpy`](struct.Memcpy.html)
//!  for details.
//!
//! DMA types support either [`Linear`](struct.Linear.html) or [`Circular`](struct.Circular.html)
//! memory buffers. Either may be used as a DMA transfer source or destination. Both are backed
//! by statically-allocated [`Buffer`s](struct.Buffer.html). A user will create a memory buffer,
//! then pass ownership to a DMA type that defines a transfer. When the transfer completes, the
//! DMA type will release ownership back to the user.
//!
//! # Terms
//!
//! - *Source* is a location in memory that provides data. A source may be a buffer
//!    of data, or a peripheral register.
//! - *Destination* is a location in memory that will receive data.
//!   A destination may be a buffer of data, or a peripheral register.
//! - *Transfer* is an overloaded term, meaning either a DMA transfer, or the movement
//!   of data out of software, through a peripheral, to an external device.
//! - *DMA Transfer* is an operation achieved by the DMA controller to move data from a
//!   source to a destination.
//! - *Receive* means that we're moving data into software, through a peripheral, from an
//!   external device.
//!
//! # Example: Full-Duplex SPI Peripheral
//!
//! In this example, we prepare a SPI peripheral (SPI4) with two DMA
//! channels. One channel will send data; the other will receive data.
//! The example assumes that the user has registered a DMA interrupt
//! handler, since we're enabling an interrupt when the receive completes.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use imxrt1060_hal::dma::{Circular, Buffer, Linear, Peripheral, bidirectional_u16};
//!
//! // Circular buffers have alignment requirements
//! #[repr(align(512))]
//! struct Align(Buffer<[u16; 256]>);
//!
//! // Two buffers that can support maximum receive and transfer sizes of 256 elements
//! static RX_BUFFER: Buffer<[u16; 256]> = Buffer::new([0; 256]);
//! static TX_BUFFER: Align = Align(Buffer::new([0; 256]));
//!
//! let mut peripherals = imxrt1060_hal::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!
//! //
//! // SPI setup...
//! //
//!
//! let (_, _, _, spi4_builder) = peripherals.spi.clock(
//!     &mut peripherals.ccm.handle,
//!     imxrt1060_hal::ccm::spi::ClockSelect::Pll2,
//!     imxrt1060_hal::ccm::spi::PrescalarSelect::LPSPI_PODF_5,
//! );
//!
//! let mut spi4 = spi4_builder.build(
//!     peripherals.iomuxc.b0.p02,
//!     peripherals.iomuxc.b0.p01,

//! //
//! // DMA setup
//! //
//!
//! let mut dma_channels = peripherals.dma.clock(&mut peripherals.ccm.handle);
//!
//! // i.MX RT DMA interrupt handlers manage pairs of DMA channels. There's one
//! // interrupt for DMA channel 9 and channel 25. By selecting these two
//! // DMA channels, we can register one interrupt to handle both DMA channel
//! // completion.
//! let tx_channel = dma_channels[9].take().unwrap();
//! let mut rx_channel = dma_channels[25].take().unwrap();
//!
//! // We only want to interrupt when the receive completes. When
//! // the receive completes, we know that we're also done transferring
//! // data.
//! rx_channel.set_interrupt_on_completion(true);
//!
//! // The peripheral will transfer and receive u16 elements.
//! // It takes ownership of the SPI object, and the two DMA channels.
//! let mut peripheral = bidirectional_u16(
//!     spi4,
//!     tx_channel,
//!     rx_channel,
//! );
//!
//! // Create DMA memory adapters over the statically-allocated DMA memory.
//! // These adapters will 'own' the statically-allocated memory. See the
//! // Linear and Circular docs for more information.
//! let mut tx_buffer = Circular::new(&TX_BUFFER.0).unwrap();
//! let mut rx_buffer = Linear::new(&RX_BUFFER).unwrap();
//!
//! // Send 6 elements, and expect to receive 6 elements
//! for v in 1..=6 {
//!     tx_buffer.push(v);
//! }
//! rx_buffer.set_transfer_len(6);
//!
//! // Start the DMA transfers
//! peripheral.start_receive(rx_buffer).unwrap();
//! peripheral.start_transfer(tx_buffer).unwrap();
//!
//! // At this point, the DMA controller is transferring data from
//! // the SPI peripheral, and receiving data from the SPI peripheral.
//! // Received data appears in RX_BUFFER. The DMA controller will trigger
//! // an interrupt for DMA channel 25 when it has transferred 6 u16s.
//! //
//! // Your ISR should clear the interrupt and complete the transfers,
//! // as depicted below:
//!
//! while peripheral.is_receive_interrupt() {
//!     peripheral.receive_clear_interrupt();
//! }
//!
//! let mut rx_buffer = None;
//! if peripheral.is_receive_complete() {
//!     // Recover the receive buffer
//!     rx_buffer = peripheral.receive_complete();
//! }
//!
//! let mut tx_buffer = None;
//! if peripheral.is_transfer_complete() {
//!     // Recover the transfer buffer
//!     tx_buffer = peripheral.transfer_complete();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Example: memcpy
//!
//! See the [`Memcpy`](struct.Memcpy.html#example) documentation for an example of DMA-powered memcpy.
//!
//! # Notes on Data Cache
//!
//! If your i.MX RT system is using a data cache (DCache), you're responsible for issuing memory barriers,
//! and flushing any cached buffers, for the DMA controller. More generally, you're responsible for placing
//! your DMA buffers into memory regions that the DMA controller can use.
//!
//! ## TODO
//!
//! - Channel arbitration modes
//! - Channel grouping
//! - Channel priority, and channel priority swapping
//! - Channel chaining
